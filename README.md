# WCAG Checker

Audit a Figma component against WCAG 2.1 Level AA. Two versions — pick the one that matches how you work.

| | Claude Code skill | Figma plugin |
|---|---|---|
| **Lives in** | Claude Code (CLI / IDE / web) | Figma Desktop |
| **You invoke it by** | Typing `/wcag-checker` in chat | Importing the manifest, then **Plugins → Development → WCAG AA Auditor** |
| **Audience** | Anyone already using Claude Code; engineers, technical designers | Designers, PMs, anyone in Figma |
| **Talks to Figma via** | Figma Desktop MCP (Dev Mode) | Native Figma Plugin API |
| **AI for visual review** | Uses your Claude Code model | Bring your own OpenRouter / Anthropic / Google key |
| **Install** | Already there if you have Claude Code; this repo's skill files register automatically | Download zip from Releases, import manifest |
| **Lives in this repo at** | `SKILL.md`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `docs/`, `scripts/` | `figma-plugin/` |

Both versions check the same 9 WCAG criteria, produce the same audit format, and arrive at the same conclusions. Pick the version that fits your workflow.

> **MCP** = Model Context Protocol — the bridge that lets Claude Code read structured data from Figma Desktop's Dev Mode. The plugin doesn't use MCP because it runs *inside* Figma and reads nodes via Figma's own Plugin API.

## Download — Figma plugin

The plugin ships as a single zip per release. No Node, no terminal, no source build.

1. Grab the latest zip from [Releases](https://github.com/r1ckrck/wcag-checker/releases/latest)
2. Unzip
3. Open Figma Desktop → **Plugins → Development → Import plugin from manifest…** → pick `manifest.json`
4. Run via **Plugins → Development → WCAG AA Auditor**

The deterministic checks (color contrast, typography, form labels, variant focus/error states) run immediately on whatever component you have selected — no setup needed.

For the **AI checks** (visual review and image-of-text), click the gear icon at the top right of the plugin and add a key from one of:

- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) — single key reaches Claude, GPT, Gemini, and others
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com)
- [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

Pick a provider, paste your key, Save. Your key is stored per-user on your own machine and never leaves it except as the request header to the provider you chose.

For source / development work on the plugin, see [`figma-plugin/README.md`](./figma-plugin/README.md).

## Use — Claude Code skill

Requires the Figma Desktop MCP (Dev Mode) to be connected to Claude Code.

1. Select a single component in Figma
2. In Claude Code, type `/wcag-checker`

The skill validates the selection, pulls the node data through MCP, runs four parallel subagents (one per WCAG cluster), and prints a structured audit with passes, flags, AI visual observations, and manual checks you'll need to do yourself.

Sibling commands for broader scopes:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/wcag-checker` | Audit one component |
| `/wcag-page` | Page-level checklist (heading hierarchy, landmarks, language, etc.) |
| `/wcag-journey` | Multi-screen flow checks (focus order across screens, error recovery) |
| `/wcag-dev` | Post-handoff checks (after the Figma design has been built into code) |
| `/wcag-manual` | The checks AI cannot reliably do — for human review |

The full skill workflow is documented in [`docs/testing-workflow.md`](./docs/testing-workflow.md).

## What gets checked

Both versions run the same 9 deterministic WCAG 2.1 AA criteria:

| Code | Name | What it tests |
|---|---|---|
| 1.4.1 | Use of Color | Error states differ from default by more than just color |
| 1.4.3 | Contrast (Minimum) | Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (or 3:1 for large text) |
| 1.4.5 | Images of Text | Asset names + AI classifier for baked-in UI text |
| 1.4.11 | Non-Text Contrast | Interactive shapes vs background ≥ 3:1 |
| 1.4.12 | Text Spacing | Line-height ≥ 1.5×, letter-spacing ≥ 0.12× |
| 2.4.7 | Focus Visible | Focus state is visually distinct from default |
| 3.3.1 | Error Identification | Errors use more than just color to communicate |
| 3.3.2 | Labels or Instructions | Form inputs have labels (real or geometrically inferred) |
| 3.3.3 | Error Suggestion | Error text is specific, not vague |

Plus an **AI-augmented visual review** for issues a deterministic check can't catch (visual hierarchy gaps, color-coded grouping, etc.) and three **manual checks** always shown as a bottom note (1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics, 2.2.2 Pause/Stop/Hide, 2.5.1 Pointer Gestures + Motion Actuation).

## How it was built

The project started as a **Claude Code skill**. One `SKILL.md` orchestrates the audit; four subagents — contrast, typography, variant, visual-review — run in parallel via Claude Code's `Agent` tool. Python helpers (`scripts/contrast-ratio.py`, `scripts/text-spacing-check.py`) handle the WCAG math. All Figma data comes through the **Figma MCP** — `get_design_context()`, `get_metadata()`, `use_figma()` — so the audit reads structured node trees, never screenshots. The 5-phase workflow (validate → collect → parse → test → output) is documented in `docs/testing-workflow.md`.

The **Figma plugin** is a ground-up port of that skill into native TypeScript that runs inside Figma's plugin sandbox. It reads nodes through the Figma Plugin API instead of MCP. The deterministic checks are direct re-implementations of the Python helpers in TypeScript, so the math gives identical results. The two AI-augmented checks (visual review and image-of-text) call the user's chosen provider directly from the UI iframe using a key the user pastes once and stores per-user via `figma.clientStorage`. A small **provider abstraction** in `figma-plugin/src/ui/ai/` hides the per-service quirks of OpenRouter, Anthropic, and Google behind a single `VisionProvider` interface.

Both versions converge on the same audit format. Whichever you use, the result is the same.
